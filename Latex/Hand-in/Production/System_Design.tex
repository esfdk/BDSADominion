\subsection{System design}
\subsubsection{General}
We decided to use an MVC pattern for our overall structure, because we felt we could seperate the model (the Gamestate), the View (GUI) and Control (Game Logic and more). We also use a Client-Server architecture to do the network communcation.

\subsubsection{GUI}
\subparagraph{Frederik Lysgaard}
In terms of system design, there isn't really much to say to the GUI part since none of us knew XNA framework, and therefore didn't have any knowledge of the limitations. This led to a very ad hoc way of designing the GUI system design, for the first draft i used my exstensive knowledge of the game to try and get a overview of the components need to proberly display and play a game of dominion. 
This resulted in the basic design for gui, but since I was still a newbeginner to XNA this led to a design with almost the right classes but with some strange inheritance, all in all it felt weird which made me study XNA some more and after have used some days getting familiar with framework i came up with the second and final draft. Even though this was the final draft, it was far from perfect, i would for example if had had more time with XNA before the project suggested some inheritance between the zones since they all is mad from the same sprite "template". So to summarize there wasn't really any general battle plan for the GUI system design at the start of the project, which was a challenge, that taught me one thing if you know your going to work in a new framework, learn it beforehand.
