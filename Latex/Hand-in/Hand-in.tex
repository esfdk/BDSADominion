\section{Overview}
This project is about our virtual representation of the card game Dominion. Dominion is a turn-based, deck-building game. The objective of the game is to use Action cards to improve your chances or damage the opponent players and using Treasure cards to buy more powerful Action/Treasure/Victory cards to gain the upper hand. 

We are planning on using a Model-View-Controller architecture. We want to separate our GUI from both the game rules and the state of the game via the controller. In essence we are likely to have a somewhat static model of the rules and a more dynamic and changing model of the state of the current game.

Frederik Lysgaard is the guy responsible for the design of our graphical interface. He is also the best Dominion player in our group. Because of this, he knows a lot of the usual strategies and is our general "go-to" guy when it comes to the tactics of the game.

Christian Jensen is responsible for implementing the way the different cards interact with the state of the game when used. Christian is also the guy who will be looking into the networking portion of the project if/when it becomes relevant.

Jakob Melnyk is responsible for modeling the state of the game and the communication between the GUI and the model (in our model-view-controller architecture). Jakob  Melnyk is also the "version-control-guy", the person with the final word in discussions and the general log-keeper for the group.
